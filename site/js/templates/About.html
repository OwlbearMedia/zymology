<p class="lead">Fermentation. That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about.</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s about more than just fermentation. It&#8217;s about making the ideal beer.</p>
<p>An ideal triangle is a figure with perfectly drawn lines whose angles add to 180 degrees, even with the most precise of tools with which to measure and draw, any triangle created by humans will be an imperfect representation of this ideal.</p>
<p>Much the same is true of beer. Even the best, most expertly crafted beer we experience will contain imperfections, however slight. It is our mission as zymologists to be ever striving towards that ideal form.</p>
<p>Just as artists, philosophers, and mathematicians aspiring towards the ideal triangle must make use of a ruler and protractor, a zymologist aspiring to brew the ideal beer must make use of the proper tools. That&#8217;s why we've created the <strong>Zymology Enhancement Suite</strong>. While there are many tools available to the idealistic brewer we are committed to making our tools the best there is. As close to perfect as mere humans can produce.</p>
